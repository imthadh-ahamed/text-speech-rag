Programming Fundamentals

Introduction to Programming
Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to execute. It involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and expressing the solution in a language that computers can understand.

Core Programming Concepts

Variables and Data Types
Variables are containers that store data values. Different programming languages support various data types:

Primitive Data Types:
- Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 42, -17, 0)
- Float/Double: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5)
- Boolean: True or false values
- Character: Single letters or symbols
- String: Sequences of characters

Control Structures
Control structures determine the flow of program execution:

Conditional Statements:
- if-else: Execute code based on conditions
- switch/case: Multiple condition checking
- Ternary operator: Shorthand conditional

Loops:
- for loop: Iterate a specific number of times
- while loop: Continue while condition is true
- do-while loop: Execute at least once, then check condition

Functions and Methods
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks:
- Parameters: Input values passed to functions
- Return values: Output from functions
- Local vs Global scope: Variable accessibility
- Recursion: Functions calling themselves

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and Objects
- Class: Blueprint or template for creating objects
- Object: Instance of a class with specific values
- Constructor: Special method for initializing objects

Core OOP Principles:
1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together
2. Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones
3. Polymorphism: Same interface for different underlying forms
4. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details

Data Structures

Arrays and Lists
- Array: Fixed-size collection of elements
- List: Dynamic collection that can grow/shrink
- Index: Position of element in collection
- Iteration: Processing each element

Advanced Data Structures:
- Stack: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure
- Queue: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure
- Linked List: Elements connected through pointers
- Hash Table: Key-value pair storage
- Tree: Hierarchical data structure
- Graph: Network of connected nodes

Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort: Compare adjacent elements
- Selection Sort: Find minimum and swap
- Insertion Sort: Insert elements in correct position
- Quick Sort: Divide and conquer approach
- Merge Sort: Divide, sort, and merge

Searching Algorithms:
- Linear Search: Check each element sequentially
- Binary Search: Divide search space in half

Algorithm Analysis:
- Time Complexity: How runtime scales with input size
- Space Complexity: How memory usage scales
- Big O Notation: Mathematical notation for complexity

Software Development Best Practices

Code Quality:
- Readable and maintainable code
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Comments and documentation
- Consistent formatting and style

Testing:
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components
- Integration Testing: Testing component interactions
- Debugging: Finding and fixing errors

Version Control:
- Git: Distributed version control system
- Repositories: Storage for project files
- Commits: Snapshots of project state
- Branches: Parallel development paths

Problem-Solving Approach:
1. Understand the problem
2. Break down into smaller parts
3. Plan the solution
4. Implement step by step
5. Test and debug
6. Optimize if needed
